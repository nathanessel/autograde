---------------------------

This project contains three scripts that are used to create .pdf files from all subdirectories of a hard coded directory.

The hard coded directory is located in the autograde script.  The autograde script is the only one that needs to be executed by the user, as this script will call the others.

The scripts then compiles the house.c files of the subdirectories and creates .pdf with details regarding them.  It then saves the .pdf as the students' user names in order to make grading them easier.
