---------------------------

This project contains three scripts that are used to create .pdf files from all subdirectories of an inputted directory.

The inputted directory is currently hard coded in the autograde script.  The autograde script is the only one that needs to be executed by the user, as this script will call the others.

The script then compiles the house.c files of the subdirectories and creates .pdf's with details regarding them.  It then saves the .pdf's as the students' user names in the directory that the script is located in order to make grading the programs easier.
